  There are now three types of filters for COPS -- the one in CARP, the
one in "cops_filter", and the one in "gen_fix".  They are all similar in
their mechanism, but are to be used for different reasons.  This is just
a short overview of what they do, and how they interact.

1) "cops_filter" (or whatever file you designate with the -f flag.)  This
takes place *BEFORE* the "gen_fix" filter (or whatever you designate
with the -g flag.)

Philosphy -- many things are flagged by COPS as a potential problem.  Some
	of these aren't really a problem, but it's not always practical
	(and is undesirable, from a software engineering standpoint) to
	hard code these things into the COPS package.  By using "cops_filter",
	you can eliminate the warnings from the final result file.

2) "gen_fix" filter.  This happens *after* the "cops_filter".  It generates
a shell fix for various warning messages generated by COPS (mostly
permissions.)

Philosophy -- some things are problems, but too sensitive or tricky to fix
automatically.  Put them here.

3) CARP filter.  Strips out various warnings that might not apply to the
entire network model, or can be used on hosts reports that didn't use
the "cops_filter", or whatever.  This obviously takes place after the
"cops_filter", and "gen_fix" filter doesn't affect it at all.

Philosophy -- not much :-)  You can use this as an overview tool; if you
have a problem that you fixed on all your hosts, then you can use this
to run over your old report files and look at the next-most-serious problem.
Alternately, you can try a "what if" kind of thing, I guess.
