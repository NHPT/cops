   For those who need fast password cracking, for whatever reason,
pick up Crack, available via uunet (ftp.uu.net), in the comp.sources.misc
archive.  Matt Bishop (matt.bishop@dartmouth.edu) wrote a great proactive
password checker (dissalows users from picking a dumb password in the first
place, rather than stumbling around and trying to crack them.)  I think it's
available via anon-ftp, at dartmouth.edu.
