COPS!

Estne volumen in toga, an solum tibi libet me videre?

COPS is what I used to be known for, way back in the way back days...

To get a general overview on what COPS is (besides being a static
UNIX security auditing tool), you can check out the various README
files... README.1 was the initial one and had all the basic
descriptions.

It looks like the last released version was back in '91 or so...
how time does fly by. Perhaps only interesting for digital
archeologists.
